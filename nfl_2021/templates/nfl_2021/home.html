        <h1> Welcome To NFL prognosticate! </h1>
        <p></p>
    <h3>  What is this? What does it mean? How does it work? Why am I here?</h3>
        <h2>
    <ul>
    <li>This website presents an opportunity to prognosticate on the scores of games in the upcoming NFL season. This exercise is called <a href="/cool_form">Submit</a>. </li>
      <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;">
            <li>Prognostications must be made prior to the beginning of the season and encompass the entire season</li>
        </ol>
    <li>You can compare what you prognosticated with what other dudes prognosticated. This exercise is called <a href="/results">Compare</a>. </li>
    <li>When the time space continuum carries us from the realm of prognostication into the realm of reflection you can compare prognostications with cold, hard, refreshing reality (insofar as reality is reflected in the scores of football games). This exercise is called <a href="/accuracy">Accuracy</a>. </li>
    <li>Accuracy will be graded using a technically advanced algorithm made specifically out of sophisticated math.</li>
    <li>You may be curious to know that the math algorithm works thusly: </li>
     <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;">
            <li>How closely you progged the point differential ie the spread</li>
            <li>How closely you progged total points scored ie the overunder</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Below is the grading rubric. The final grade is an equal blend of your performance on items (a) and (b), ie (a+b)/2</li>
    </ul>
